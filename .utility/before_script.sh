# 2.5.4 uses FindBugs 2.0.3, which does not work well with Java 1.8. From

# The current version of FindBugs may encounter errors when analyzing Java 1.8
# bytecode, due to changes in the classfile format. After FindBugs 2.0.3 is
# released, work will start on the next major release of FindBugs, which will
# be able to analyze Java 1.8 (and will require Java 1.7 to compile and run).
